This is a framework for creating projectional editors which interact with JetBrains MPS.

So you will need to use MPS together with the [MPSServer plugin](https://github.com/Strumenta/MPSServer).

An example is available [here](https://github.com/Strumenta/calc-webeditkit-example).
It contains also some basic instructions on how to use MPSServer and WebEditKit.

## Structure of the project

* **css**: it contains an example of CSS file to be used in the projects based on WebEditKit
* **src**: the source code of this project, in TypeScript

## Development

We suggest using nvm to specify the exact version of node we use.
