# WebEditKit

![](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/webeditkit?style=plastic)

This is a framework for creating projectional editors which interact with JetBrains MPS.

So you will need to use MPS together with the [MPSServer plugin](https://github.com/Strumenta/MPSServer).

An example is available [here](https://github.com/Strumenta/calc-webeditkit-example).
